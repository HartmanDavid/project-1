Project #1 - DOGGIE OBSTACLES! version 1.5 7/6/15

doggies avoid obstacles, pee on plants, and eat the food. Each step earning points. 

Dogs start on the left running in place. Object come up to them (as if on a conveyor belt) and player act accordingly to gain points. 
	bowls of food - dog eats to keep up energy and gain points
	plants and flowers - dogs pee on each and get points
	small fence and other - dog jumps over to get points
	
Winner has most points at end of time/level.

This completes the MVP for the project.

If MVP completed - additions:

-Distractions would happen randomly: dogs would have to poo, flowers would bloom and the dogs would like to stop and smell them instead of pee on them, skate boarders would ride by and dogs would try to eat them, etc.

-As the dogs run and the players go up levels things get faster and harder: 

-Players have the option of picking which dog to use to play. 

-Each dog would have Pros & Cons: how fast it eats, how fast it runs, how fast it poops, what it gets distracted by, how quickly it eats, how much it eats before it needs to poo, and when it gets tired thus needing rest.
