Project #1 - DOG RACE! verison 1.0 7/6/15

dogs race from side to side to eat the food:

starting on the left dogs run to eat food out of the bowl on the right,
	finish food, 
	and run back to the left for more food,
	and on and on.

Distractions would happen randomly when running from side to side: dogs would have to poo, flowers would bloom and the dogs would like to stop and smell them, skate boarders would ride by and dogs would chase, etc.

As the dogs run and the players go up levels things get faster and harder: 

Players have the option of picking which dog to use to play. 

Each dog would have Pros & Cons: how fast it eats, how fast it runs, how fast it poops, what it gets distracted by, how quickly it eats, how much it eats before it poos, and when it gets tired thus needing rest. 

Board levels: 

starting levels would be easy - less distractions, medium food amounts.
